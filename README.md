# polyhedron

Polyhedral is a modular multi-faceted tutoring center application designed for school use. Polyhedral allows student and tutors to sign in to a center. Students are able to place tutoring requests that tutors then accept. One important thing polyhedral does is keep all open terminals up to date, which is accomplished through the use of websockets. Administrators can also change aspects of the various tutoring center at a school while the program is running. The last thing is that Administrators can generate various reports of the different tutoring centers and download then in a excel spreadsheet.
